---------------------

:+1: This PR looks great - it's ready to merge! :shipit:

But if there is just one it works perfectly fine, or if there are no text between them.
I.e. :green_heart: renders fine for me
As well as :green_heart: :green_heart:
But
:green_heart: Hello World :green_heart:
does not
